What is it?

Calling a method to choose a random number from a randomly generated array of integers for a fixed amount of times. 
After which we count how many times each number has been generated.
Finally, we calculate the density of each number (number of times it has been chosen compared to the total number of calls.)

The functionality is covered by unit tests.
